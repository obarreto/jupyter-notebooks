np.array Creates an array for which the elements are given by an array-like object,
which, for example, can be a (nested) Python list, a tuple, an iterable
sequence, or another ndarray instance.
"""
np.zeros Creates an array with the specified dimensions and data type that is filled
with zeros.

np.ones Creates an array with the specified dimensions and data type that is filled
with ones.

np.diag Creates a diagonal array with specified values along the diagonal and
zeros elsewhere.

np.arange Creates an array with evenly spaced values between the specified start,
end, and increment values.

np.linspace Creates an array with evenly spaced values between specified start and
end values, using a specified number of elements.

np.logspace Creates an array with values that are logarithmically spaced between the
given start and end values.

np.meshgrid Generates coordinate matrices (and higher-dimensional coordinate arrays)
from one-dimensional coordinate vectors.

np.fromfunction Creates an array and fills it with values specified by a given function,
which is evaluated for each combination of indices for the given array size.

np.fromfile Creates an array with the data from a binary (or text) file. NumPy also
provides a corresponding function np.tofile with which NumPy arrays
can be stored to disk and later read back using np.fromfile.

np.genfromtxt,np. Create an array from data read from a text file, for example, a comma-
loadtxt
separated value (CSV) file. The function np.genfromtxt also supports
data files with missing values.

np.random.rand
Generates an array with random numbers that are uniformly distributed
between 0 and 1. Other types of distributions are also available in the np.
random module.
